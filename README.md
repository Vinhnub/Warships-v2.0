an intense battle of wits on the open seas.

===========================        Gameplay        ===========================

In Warship, each player commands a hidden fleet arranged on a grid map.

Your task is to use strategy and deduction to locate and destroy all of your opponent's ships.

The game is played in turns:

Each turn, you choose a coordinate to attack.

If it hits an opponent's ship, the bullet will turn orange and you can attack again on the next turn; if it misses, the turn passes to the opponent.

If it hits an opponent's radar, the bullet will turn blue and you will have more radar to use.

When using the radar, it scans a 9x9 area and returns the number of ship tiles in that area.

Victory goes to the player who destroys the entire opponent's fleet first. Each match is a tense battle of wits, where every decision can change the outcome of the battle.
